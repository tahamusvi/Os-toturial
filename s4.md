 3  cat /etc/passwd
 4  hostname
 5  history
```

This shows the last 5 commands that were executed.

**Some key points about the `history` command:**

- The history is stored in-memory for the current session, and the size of the history is usually configurable.
- You can reference a previous command by its history number, e.g., `!3` will re-execute the 3rd command in the history.
- The `history` command can also be used with options to search, filter, or clear the command history.
- Common options include:
  - `-c`: Clear the command history
  - `-w`: Write the current history to the history file
  - `-r`: Read the history file and append it to the current history
- The command history is typically stored in a hidden file (e.g., `~/.bash_history`) and persists across shell sessions.
- Reviewing the command history can be useful for debugging, recalling previous actions, and learning from your own workflow.

The `history` command is a handy tool for navigating and managing your command-line history in a Linux environment. It can greatly improve productivity and help you keep track of your past actions.
#

## alias

- The `alias` command is used to create shortcuts for longer or more complex commands.

Syntax:
```
alias shortcut='long_command'
```

For example:
```
alias CD='cd ~/Desktop'
```

This creates a shortcut called `CD` that will execute the command `cd ~/Desktop` when typed.

Some key points about using `alias`:

- The alias is only valid within the current shell session. To make it permanent, you can add the alias to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.).
- Aliases can include command-line options, arguments, and even multiple commands chained together.
- Aliases can be used to simplify frequently used, complex, or hard-to-remember commands.
- They can also be used to create custom shortcuts for your own workflow and preferences.
- To view all currently defined aliases, you can use the `alias` command without any arguments.

#

## hostname

The `hostname` command is used to display or set the system's hostname.

**Displaying the current hostname:**

```
hostname
```

This will simply print the current hostname of the system.

**Changing the hostname:**

```
hostname redhat
```

This will change the system's hostname to "redhat". 

Some key points about using `hostname`:

- The hostname is the unique name that identifies a computer on a network.
- Changing the hostname can be useful for identifying different systems, especially in a multi-server environment.
- The new hostname is usually only valid for the current session. To make the change permanent, you'll need to update the system's configuration files.
- On Linux, the hostname is often stored in the `/etc/hostname` file. You may need to edit this file and reboot the system to make the hostname change persistent.
- Some Linux distributions also have tools like `hostnamectl` that provide an easier way to manage the hostname.
- Hostname changes may require updates to other network-related configurations, such as DNS records, if the system is accessible on a network.

Being able to view and modify the hostname is a fundamental system administration task in Linux. The `hostname` command provides a simple way to get and set this important system identifier.
