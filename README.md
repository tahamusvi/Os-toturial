## Session 10: Processes in Linux

A process is an executing instance of a program that represents the running application. Processes are also referred to as running programs. Each process in the system is assigned a unique identifier called the Process ID (PID). The PID of a running process cannot be changed. However, when a process terminates, the operating system can reuse the PID for a different process.
