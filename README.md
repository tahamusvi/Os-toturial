## Session 2: file management

This session covers several essential Linux command line utilities and their usage, including:

1. `ls`: Used to list files and directories, with various options to customize the output.
2. `cp`: Allows you to copy files and directories, with options to preserve attributes and handle overwriting.
3. `mv`: Enables moving or renaming files and directories.
4. `rm`: Deletes files or directories, with options to handle recursive removal and avoid prompts.
5. `mkdir`: Creates new directories, with options to create parent directories and set permissions.
6. `rmdir`: Removes empty directories.
7. `cd`: Changes the current working directory, with shortcuts to navigate the file system.
8. Wildcards (Globbing): Special characters that can be used to match multiple files or directories in a single command.
9. `touch`: Changes the timestamp (access, modification, or change time) of a file, or creates a new file if it doesn't exist.
10. `find`: A powerful command for hierarchical file search, with various options to narrow down the search criteria.

These commands are fundamental building blocks in the Linux command line environment, allowing users to perform a wide range of file management and system navigation tasks efficiently. The explanations provided give a concise overview of the syntax, common use cases, and practical examples for each command.

1. `cat`: Used to create or display the contents of a file.
2. `head`: Displays the beginning contents of a file.
3. `tail`: Displays the ending contents of a file.
4. `wc`: Provides word, line, and character counts for a file.
5. `cut`: Extracts specific parts of each line from a file or text.
6. `less` and `more`: Used to display the contents of a file in a paginated manner.
7. `grep`: Searches for a specific pattern or string within a file or command output.
8. `echo`: Prints a message or string to the terminal.
9. Creating a new file using the `cat >` command.

These commands are fundamental tools in the Linux command line environment, allowing users to perform various file manipulation, inspection, and processing tasks efficiently. The explanations provided give a concise overview of the syntax and common use cases for each command.

## Session 4: Start with simple command part 2

The session covers several additional Linux command line utilities and their usage:

1. `man`: Displays the manual pages (man pages) for a given command or utility, providing detailed information about its syntax, options, and usage.
2. `whatis`: Displays a one-line description of a command or utility.
3. `which`: Locates the executable file associated with a given command.
4. `who`: Displays information about the users currently logged into the system.
5. `whoami`: Displays the username of the current user.
6. `date`: Displays or sets the current date and time on the system.
7. `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
8. `read`: Accepts input from the user in a terminal or shell script.
9. `shutdown`: Shuts down or reboots the system.
10. `uname`: Displays information about the current operating system and hardware.
11. `sleep`: Pauses the execution of a script or command for a specified amount of time.
12. `history`: Displays the history of previously executed commands.
13. `alias`: Creates shortcuts for longer or more complex commands.
14. `hostname`: Displays or sets the system's hostname.

## Session 8: awk
awk can process text files and streams. The input data is divided into records and fields. awk operates on one record at a time until the input is exhausted. Records are separated by a character called the record separator (RS). The default record separator is the newline character, meaning that each line in the text data is a record. A new record separator can be set using the RS variable.

## Session 9: Networking in Linux
Configuration, monitoring, and security are the main and essential duties of a network administrator. In computer networks, whether small-scale like a home network or large-scale like WAN networks, there is a need to configure the devices connected to the network.

## Session 10: Processes in Linux

A process is an executing instance of a program that represents the running application. Processes are also referred to as running programs. Each process in the system is assigned a unique identifier called the Process ID (PID). The PID of a running process cannot be changed. However, when a process terminates, the operating system can reuse the PID for a different process.
