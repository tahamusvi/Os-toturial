# Session 6

The best way to protect important and vital data is to backup and maintain a backup copy in another location, which could be another partition of the disk, CD/DVD, or any other system on the network. It is better to backup the important and critical data at regular intervals or at least before and after any changes to the system. We usually backup the directories such as /etc/, /var, /home, /root, /opt/, and /boot/.

#
- Backup operations can be performed automatically using the cron service.


- The tar (archive tape) command: This command can be used to package and archive (archive) all the information. In other words, it can archive or create an archive file containing multiple files and directories.

#
The syntax for the tar command is:
```
tar [options] [source_file/directory] [destination_file]
```
Where:
- The destination is the location where the backup file will be stored.
- The source is the files/directories we want to backup.

Some common options for the tar command:
- c - Create a new archive
- r - Add files to an existing archive
- p - Preserve file permissions
- P - Backup the entire contents of a directory
- f - Specify the archive file name
- g - Used for differential backups
- u - Update the archive after changes to the original files
- d - Compare the archive and the original files
- x - Extract files from the archive
- z - Compress/uncompress the archive using gzip
- j - Compress/uncompress the archive using bzip2
- C - Do not use the current directory for extraction

#
The cpio (copy in/out) command:
- o - For creating a backup
- i - For restoring a backup

#

## at 

The `at` command is used to execute a program automatically only once. To run this command, first type the following command:
```
sudo apt install at
```
This means we want to perform a task once at a specific time in the future. After running the `at` command, we enter the `at` environment and can enter the commands we want to be executed at the scheduled time line by line.

## Desired date and time for at

Some of the parameters that are used in the `at` command are as follows:
- `now`: means to execute the desired command at the current time.
- `m`: After the task is completed, an email is sent to the corresponding user.
- `c`: To view the job content
  ```
  at –c jobid
  ```
- `d`: To delete a job
  ```
  at –d job
  ```
- `letter q`: Prioritizes the job, and `letter` means the letters `z-a`, and the closer the letter is to `z`, the lower the priority of the job execution.
  ```
  at now +2 min –q v
  ```
- `min +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 minutes later.
- `hours +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 hours later.
- `days +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 days later.
- `weeks +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 weeks later.
- `months +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 months later.
- `tomorrow`: means to execute the desired task the next day.
- `teatime`: means to execute the desired task at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
- `midnight`: means to execute the desired task at midnight.

## Examples:

```
at now
at> ls –l >>f1
at > echo "finished" >> f1
Ctrl+D
```
In this example, by entering the `now at` command to the system, we tell it to perform a task for us right now, and then with the `<at` prompt, we start entering the commands, and finally with `Ctrl+D` we terminate the task. Now all the commands we entered will be executed.

```
at now +3 min –f ff1
```
In this case, the commands in the `ff1` file will be automatically executed 3 minutes later.

To view the list of programs that have been scheduled using the `at` command, we use the `at -l` or `atq` commands.

To delete a job, we use the following commands:
```
at –d jobid
atrm jobid
```

There are two configuration files related to the `at` command, which are:
- `/etc/at.allow`: Only users listed in this file can run the `at` command.
- `/etc/at.deny`: Only users listed in this file cannot run the `at` command.

The way these files work is as follows:
If both files exist, only users listed in the `at.allow` file have the right to run `at`, and the `at.deny` file is ignored.
And if none of these files exist, except for `root`, no other user has the right to run the `at` command.

#
## cron
This program executes the tasks defined in the `/etc/crontab` file at the scheduled time. The `/etc/crontab` file has a specific format, with the rows of this file consisting of seven fields. The first five fields from the left determine the execution time of the desired command or task, the sixth field specifies the username under whose name the command or task will be executed, and the last (seventh) field specifies the command or program to be executed.

- The first field from the left represents the minutes (m) and ranges from 0-59. If `*/5` is written in this field, it means every 5 minutes.
- The second field from the left represents the hour (h) and ranges from 0-23. If `*` is in this field, it means every hour.
- The third field from the left represents the day of the month (dom) and ranges from 1-31.
- The fourth field from the left represents the month of the year (mon) and ranges from 1-12.
- The fifth field from the left represents the day of the week (dow) and ranges from 0-7.
  - (0 and 7 mean Sunday, 1 means Monday, 2 means Tuesday, 3 means Wednesday, 4 means Thursday, 5 means Friday, and 6 means Saturday)

Each user can have their own `crontab` file, which is located in the `/var/spool/cron` directory. Each user can create their own `crontab` file using the `crontab` command.

The system also has its own `crontab` file in the `/etc/crontab` or `/etc/cron.d` directory.

Similar to the `at` command, here too, the `/etc/cron.allow` and `/etc/cron.deny` files specify the authorized and unauthorized users for running `cron` and using the `cron` service.

- `crontab -e`
  Creates the `crontab` file for the desired user in the `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` directory.
- `crontab -l`
  Displays the contents of the `crontab` file.

Example:
```
30 14 5 * * tar --czf backup1.tar.zip
```
The line above in the `crontab` file means that a backup of the user's home directory should be performed at 14:30 on the 5th of every month.

The `root` user can modify the `crontab` file of any user.
This can be done using the `crontab` command with the appropriate parameters.

Example:
```
crontab -e -u user1
```
This command will modify the `crontab` file for the `user1` user.

With the `-r` parameter, you can delete the `crontab` file.
```
crontab -r -u user1
```

There are several directories:
- `/etc/cron.hourly`
- `/etc/cron.daily`
- `/etc/cron.weekly`
- `/etc/cron.monthly`

You can use these directories to perform specific operations on an hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly basis. All you need to do is save the commands that are to be executed at these times in a file and place that file in one of the aforementioned directories, depending on when it is supposed to be executed. This way, the operations described in that file will be performed as specified.

The files inside these directories are executed in alphabetical order, so if you want the first file to be executed, you should choose the name of the file so that it is executed first.

Inside the `/etc/crontab` file, there are a few lines dedicated to specifying the execution time of the tasks under these directories. The `parts-run` expression that appears before the names of the mentioned directories causes all the files within the corresponding directory to be executed.

By default, the result of running the `cron` command is sent by email to the user who executed it.


#

## anacron
The `anacron` command can be used to execute scheduled tasks that were not performed at their scheduled time due to the system being turned off.

The `anacron` command also executes the commands inside the `/etc/anacrontab` file. After the `anacron` program is installed and the corresponding service starts, the system checks every time it turns on, and if there are any tasks that should have been executed at a specific time but were not, `anacron` will detect and execute them.

The format of the `/etc/anacrontab` file is similar to the `/etc/crontab` file, with the following differences:

- The first three fields represent the period (in days) between executions, the delay (in minutes) before the first execution, and a unique job identifier, respectively.
- The fourth field represents the command or program to be executed.
- There is no field for specifying the minute, hour, day, month, or day of the week.

For example:
```
7 10 cron.daily run-parts --report /etc/cron.daily
```
This line means that the commands in the `/etc/cron.daily` directory should be executed every 7 days, with a 10-minute delay after the system starts up.

The advantage of using `anacron` over `cron` is that `anacron` ensures that scheduled tasks are executed, even if the system was turned off at the scheduled time. `anacron` will execute the missed tasks the next time the system is turned on.

However, `anacron` is not suitable for tasks that need to be executed at a specific time, as it only ensures that the tasks are executed, not at a specific time. For such tasks, `cron` is more appropriate.


#

## zip
The `zip` command has the capability to create archive versions as well.

Syntax:
```
zip [options] destination_file source_file(s)
```

Options:
- `-r`: Compresses the contents of the directory recursively.
- `-e`: For encryption.
- `-d`: Deletes the input file in the compressed file.
- `-T`: To test the integrity of the archive file.

Examples:

1. Creating a zip archive:
   ```
   zip backup.zip file1.txt file2.txt
   ```
   This will create a zip file named `backup.zip` that contains `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.

2. Compressing a directory recursively:
   ```
   zip -r documents.zip /path/to/documents
   ```
   This will create a zip file named `documents.zip` that contains all the files and subdirectories in the `/path/to/documents` directory.

3. Encrypting a zip file:
   ```
   zip -e secure_backup.zip important_files/
   ```
   This will create an encrypted zip file named `secure_backup.zip` that contains the contents of the `important_files/` directory.

4. Deleting a file from a zip archive:
   ```
   zip -d backup.zip file_to_delete.txt
   ```
   This will remove the `file_to_delete.txt` file from the `backup.zip` archive.

5. Testing the integrity of a zip archive:
   ```
   zip -T backup.zip
   ```
   This will test the integrity of the `backup.zip` archive.

The `zip` command is a powerful tool for compressing and archiving files and directories. It provides various options to customize the compression process, such as encryption, recursive compression, and file deletion within the archive.

#

## gzip
This program can be used to compress one or more files. If you compress multiple files with this command, it will compress each file individually.

Syntax:
```
gzip [options] file(s)
```

To extract a compressed file, we use the `gunzip` command:
```
gunzip file.gz
```

You can also use the `-d` option with the `gzip` command to extract a compressed file:
```
gzip -d file.gz
```

If you first combined multiple files into an archive using the `tar` command and then compressed the archive using `gzip`, to extract the contents, you need to first extract the `gzip` compression using `gunzip` or `gzip -d`, and then extract the `tar` archive using the `tar` command with the `xvf` options.

The file extension for a file that has first been archived and then compressed is `.tar.gz`.

Some additional options for the `gzip` command:

- `-r`: Compress directories recursively.
- `-k`: Keep the original file(s) after compression.
- `-l`: List information about the compressed file(s).
- `-v`: Verbose mode, shows the compression ratio.

The `gzip` command is useful for compressing individual files, while the `zip` command is more suitable for creating archives that contain multiple files and directories.

#

## bzip2
The `bzip2` command is similar to the `gzip` command. To extract the contents of a `bzip2` compressed file, we can use the `bunzip2` command or the `-d` option with the `bzip2` command.

Syntax:
```
bzip2 [options] file(s)
bunzip2 file.bz2
bzip2 -d file.bz2
```

The file extension for a `bzip2` compressed file is `.bz2`.

The compression level can be specified using numbers from 0 to 9, with higher numbers indicating stronger compression. You can use this as an option in the compression commands:

```
gzip -8 file.txt
```

This will create a highly compressed `file.txt.gz` file.

• The split command:
With this command, you can divide a file into multiple smaller files.

Syntax:
```
split [options] input_file output_file_prefix
```

Options:
- `-b size`: Specifies the size of the output files in bytes.

To reassemble the split files and recreate the original file, you can use the `cat` command:

```
cat file1 file2 file3 > original_file
```

The `bzip2` command provides better compression compared to `gzip`, especially for larger files, but it is also more CPU-intensive. The choice between `gzip` and `bzip2` depends on the specific requirements of your use case, such as the file size, required compression ratio, and available system resources.

# apt 
To use the `apt` tool, you need to use its subcommands, such as `apt`, `apt-show`, and `apt-list`. Executing `apt` commands requires the root user or using `sudo` because these commands make changes to the system's core files, such as installing, removing, and updating packages.

1. Updating the package lists:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```
   This command updates the list of available packages from the configured repositories. It's essential to run this before installing or upgrading packages.

2. Upgrading all installed packages:
   ```
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```
   This command upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions.

3. Full system upgrade:
   ```
   sudo apt full-upgrade
   ```
   This command performs a full system upgrade, including installing new dependencies and removing incompatible packages.

4. Upgrading to a new Ubuntu version:
   ```
   sudo do-release-upgrade -d
   ```
   This command upgrades the Ubuntu distribution to the latest version. Note that this is not recommended if you have a weak or unreliable internet connection, as the download process can be interrupted.

5. Installing a package:
   ```
   sudo apt install package_name
   ```
   This command installs the latest version of the specified package.
   You can also install a specific version of a package:
   ```
   sudo apt install package_name=version
   ```

6. Installing multiple packages:
   ```
   sudo apt install package1 package2 package3
   ```
   This command installs the specified packages.

The downloaded packages are stored in the `/var/cache/apt/archives` directory.

Some additional `apt` commands:
- `apt search package_name`: Searches for packages by name or description.
- `apt show package_name`: Displays information about a specific package.
- `apt list --installed`: Lists all installed packages.
- `apt remove package_name`: Removes a package.
- `apt autoremove`: Removes packages that were installed as dependencies and are no longer needed.

The `apt` command provides a convenient way to manage packages on Ubuntu and Debian-based Linux distributions. It simplifies the process of updating, upgrading, and installing software packages.
