# Session 6

The best way to protect important and vital data is to backup and maintain a backup copy in another location, which could be another partition of the disk, CD/DVD, or any other system on the network. It is better to backup the important and critical data at regular intervals or at least before and after any changes to the system. We usually backup the directories such as /etc/, /var, /home, /root, /opt/, and /boot/.

#
- Backup operations can be performed automatically using the cron service.


- The tar (archive tape) command: This command can be used to package and archive (archive) all the information. In other words, it can archive or create an archive file containing multiple files and directories.

#
The syntax for the tar command is:
```
tar [options] [source_file/directory] [destination_file]
```
Where:
- The destination is the location where the backup file will be stored.
- The source is the files/directories we want to backup.

Some common options for the tar command:
- c - Create a new archive
- r - Add files to an existing archive
- p - Preserve file permissions
- P - Backup the entire contents of a directory
- f - Specify the archive file name
- g - Used for differential backups
- u - Update the archive after changes to the original files
- d - Compare the archive and the original files
- x - Extract files from the archive
- z - Compress/uncompress the archive using gzip
- j - Compress/uncompress the archive using bzip2
- C - Do not use the current directory for extraction

#
The cpio (copy in/out) command:
- o - For creating a backup
- i - For restoring a backup

## at 

The `at` command is used to execute a program automatically only once. To run this command, first type the following command:
```
sudo apt install at
```
This means we want to perform a task once at a specific time in the future. After running the `at` command, we enter the `at` environment and can enter the commands we want to be executed at the scheduled time line by line.

## Desired date and time for at

Some of the parameters that are used in the `at` command are as follows:
- `now`: means to execute the desired command at the current time.
- `m`: After the task is completed, an email is sent to the corresponding user.
- `c`: To view the job content
  ```
  at –c jobid
  ```
- `d`: To delete a job
  ```
  at –d job
  ```
- `letter q`: Prioritizes the job, and `letter` means the letters `z-a`, and the closer the letter is to `z`, the lower the priority of the job execution.
  ```
  at now +2 min –q v
  ```
- `min +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 minutes later.
- `hours +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 hours later.
- `days +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 days later.
- `weeks +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 weeks later.
- `months +3 now`: means to execute the desired task 3 months later.
- `tomorrow`: means to execute the desired task the next day.
- `teatime`: means to execute the desired task at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
- `midnight`: means to execute the desired task at midnight.

## Examples:

```
at now
at> ls –l >>f1
at > echo "finished" >> f1
Ctrl+D
```
In this example, by entering the `now at` command to the system, we tell it to perform a task for us right now, and then with the `<at` prompt, we start entering the commands, and finally with `Ctrl+D` we terminate the task. Now all the commands we entered will be executed.

```
at now +3 min –f ff1
```
In this case, the commands in the `ff1` file will be automatically executed 3 minutes later.

To view the list of programs that have been scheduled using the `at` command, we use the `at -l` or `atq` commands.

To delete a job, we use the following commands:
```
at –d jobid
atrm jobid
```

There are two configuration files related to the `at` command, which are:
- `/etc/at.allow`: Only users listed in this file can run the `at` command.
- `/etc/at.deny`: Only users listed in this file cannot run the `at` command.

The way these files work is as follows:
If both files exist, only users listed in the `at.allow` file have the right to run `at`, and the `at.deny` file is ignored.
And if none of these files exist, except for `root`, no other user has the right to run the `at` command.

#
## cron
This program executes the tasks defined in the `/etc/crontab` file at the scheduled time. The `/etc/crontab` file has a specific format, with the rows of this file consisting of seven fields. The first five fields from the left determine the execution time of the desired command or task, the sixth field specifies the username under whose name the command or task will be executed, and the last (seventh) field specifies the command or program to be executed.

- The first field from the left represents the minutes (m) and ranges from 0-59. If `*/5` is written in this field, it means every 5 minutes.
- The second field from the left represents the hour (h) and ranges from 0-23. If `*` is in this field, it means every hour.
- The third field from the left represents the day of the month (dom) and ranges from 1-31.
- The fourth field from the left represents the month of the year (mon) and ranges from 1-12.
- The fifth field from the left represents the day of the week (dow) and ranges from 0-7.
  - (0 and 7 mean Sunday, 1 means Monday, 2 means Tuesday, 3 means Wednesday, 4 means Thursday, 5 means Friday, and 6 means Saturday)

Each user can have their own `crontab` file, which is located in the `/var/spool/cron` directory. Each user can create their own `crontab` file using the `crontab` command.

The system also has its own `crontab` file in the `/etc/crontab` or `/etc/cron.d` directory.

Similar to the `at` command, here too, the `/etc/cron.allow` and `/etc/cron.deny` files specify the authorized and unauthorized users for running `cron` and using the `cron` service.

- `crontab -e`
  Creates the `crontab` file for the desired user in the `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` directory.
- `crontab -l`
  Displays the contents of the `crontab` file.

Example:
```
30 14 5 * * tar --czf backup1.tar.zip
```
The line above in the `crontab` file means that a backup of the user's home directory should be performed at 14:30 on the 5th of every month.

The `root` user can modify the `crontab` file of any user.
This can be done using the `crontab` command with the appropriate parameters.

Example:
```
crontab -e -u user1
```
This command will modify the `crontab` file for the `user1` user.

With the `-r` parameter, you can delete the `crontab` file.
```
crontab -r -u user1
```

There are several directories:
- `/etc/cron.hourly`
- `/etc/cron.daily`
- `/etc/cron.weekly`
- `/etc/cron.monthly`

You can use these directories to perform specific operations on an hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly basis. All you need to do is save the commands that are to be executed at these times in a file and place that file in one of the aforementioned directories, depending on when it is supposed to be executed. This way, the operations described in that file will be performed as specified.

The files inside these directories are executed in alphabetical order, so if you want the first file to be executed, you should choose the name of the file so that it is executed first.

Inside the `/etc/crontab` file, there are a few lines dedicated to specifying the execution time of the tasks under these directories. The `parts-run` expression that appears before the names of the mentioned directories causes all the files within the corresponding directory to be executed.

By default, the result of running the `cron` command is sent by email to the user who executed it.
